/**
 * Quest: Depths of Despair (Main Quest)
 * =====================================
 *
 * Synopsis:
 * -----------
 * The dwarves at the Dwarven Outpost have been mining a new passage, but their excavations have caused
 * increasingly violent tremors. Durin, the outpost leader, fears a major collapse is imminent and hires
 * the player to investigate the source. The player ventures into the newly discovered "Chasm of Woe,"
 * a cavern system filled with dangerous new creatures like Chasm Crawlers and Rock Golems. Navigating
 * the treacherous paths, the player reaches the heart of the chasm and discovers the source of the
 * tremors: a colossal, ancient elemental golem known as "The Earth-Render," which has been awakened
 * by the mining. The player must defeat this powerful guardian. Upon its defeat, the tremors cease, and
 * the player can recover its crystalline core, the "Heart of the Mountain." Returning this to Durin, the
 * grateful dwarf uses his smithing expertise to fuse it with the player's Runic Pickaxe, creating a powerful,
 * Crystal-Tipped Runic Pickaxe and granted me access to a new, rich mining area.
 *
 * Why it happened:
 * ----------------
 * Driven by their innate desire to delve deep, the dwarves accidentally broke into a geologically and
 * magically unstable region. Their mining activities disturbed a major nexus of terrestrial energy,
 * awakening its ancient and powerful guardian, The Earth-Render, whose movements were causing the tremors.
 *
 * Lore Explained:
 * ---------------
 * - This quest serves as a main quest line that is independent of the overarching Serpent Bandit plot,
 *   focusing on world-building and elemental lore.
 * - It expands the world downwards, introducing a new, self-contained mid-level dungeon with its own
 *   unique ecosystem of monsters.
 * - It builds upon Dwarven lore, highlighting their ambition, their connection to the earth, and the
 *   potential dangers of "digging too greedily and too deep."
 * - Introduces the concept of powerful, primordial elemental guardians tied to specific locations,
 *   acting as protectors of the natural world.
 *
 * Approximate Duration:
 * ---------------------
 * Medium-Long (45-60 minutes). This quest is designed as a dungeon crawl, requiring the player to
 * fight through several rooms of new mid-level monsters before facing a challenging boss.
